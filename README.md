# AmNat_Medeiros_etal_2020
This is the data and code in R associated with the manuscript: "Observed ecological communities are formed by species combinations that are among the most likely to persist under changing environments" by Lucas P. Medeiros, Karina Boege, Ek del-Val, Alejandro Zaldivar-River√≥n, Serguei Saavedra. The American Naturalist.

The folder is comprised of 4 subfolders: code, data, figs, and results.

Inside code we provide the scripts to reproduce Figures 1-3 (and Appendix Figures). Figures 1 needs to run fig1_simulations.R to generate the data from simulations. Then the corresponding plot can be generated by fig1_plots.R. Figures 2B and 2C need to run fig2B_simulations.R and fig2C_simulations.R to generate the data from simulations. Then the corresponding plots can be generated by fig2_plots.R. Figure 3 needs to run fig3_analysis.R to generate the data. Then the corresponding plot can be generated by fig3_plots.R. The code is commented, self explanatory, and has different functions written as R scripts in the folder functions.

Inside data we provide the empirical matrices used in the study.

Inside results we save the results from running the simulations and the data analysis for Figures 1-3.

Inside figs we save all the figures generated.
